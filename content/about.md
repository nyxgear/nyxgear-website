My name is Stefano Cilloni and I'm a software engineer passionate about software development. I like to find and study about efficient and well-engineered solutions to solve challenging problems. My interest areas are in distributed software architectures, cloud platforms, DevOps, CI/CD toolchains.

I am fond of Python programming language and I like to invest my time in other elegant, clean and efficient languages that value human-time over machine-time.
